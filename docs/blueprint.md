## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to convey trust and authority, reflecting the official nature of the platform.
- Background color: Light gray (#EEEEEE) to ensure readability and a clean interface.
- Accent color: Teal (#009688) to highlight key actions and notifications, providing a fresh, engaging feel.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font for its modern, neutral, and readable qualities. 'Inter' ensures clarity and accessibility, supporting both body text and headlines with a clean aesthetic.
- Use consistent, simple icons from Material Design to represent actions, categories, and status indicators. Ensure icons are intuitive and universally understandable.
- Employ a card-based layout to organize information, using clear sections for events, messages, and clearance requests. Prioritize a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience, such as sliding panels for detailed views and progress indicators for QR scanning and data loading.
